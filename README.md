# Shatterline Cheat
This is an external, screen/pixel based cheat with a very simple design. It serves as a good base for any external client, and comes equipped with a module system and notification system.

The cheat includes several modules such as Aura, AimAssist, ArrayList, and ClickGUI (which is currently unfinished). The client also comes with a module system, users can easily enable or disable different modules to suit their needs.

Please note that this client was not used nor tested in multiplayer. We strongly recommend that you do not use this cheat to cheat in any online games, as it violates the terms of service and ruins the experience for other players.

Unfortunately, development of this cheat has been discontinued due to performance issues that the i was unable to resolve. However, the code is still available for others to use and build upon. 

Thank you for checking out this repository!
